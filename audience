Iden is aimed at data practitioners who had coding experience

You'll benefit from it if you are a recent graduate

Or someone looking to create your portfolio

You'll need to be proficient in Python, Pandas, and Sklearn

But if you aren't

No stress!

We have plans to develop beginner-friendly workshops for data enthusiasts

Soon :D
