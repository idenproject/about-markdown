Iden is aimed at data practitioners who had previous coding experience

You'll benefit from it if you are a recent graduate,

Or someone looking to create your portfolio.

You'll need experience with Python, Pandas, and Sklearn.

But if you aren't,

No stress!

We have plans to develop entry-level workshops

and self-learning content for data beginners.

Soon :D
