Our program is both in-person and online.

The in-person workshops series are called "Act"

Each workshop is 3-hour long with coding challenges and professional development skill sharing sessions.

We focus on commercial-inspired data topics you probably have not worked on at university.

You can attend any workshop you like, but they are limited, 

so please register your interests, and we will send you an invitation.

The online series are called "Subquest".

These are downloadable Jupyter Notebook to practice data science skills.

Guaranteed original datasets, guided instructions,

And even a skill tree to unlock !
